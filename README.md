# RAIWorkshop  (Responsible Artificial Intelligence Workshop)
A repository created by US OCP for public facing RAI Workshop Materials <br>
This repository can be accessed via: https://aka.ms/raiworkshop

## Purpose
This workshop is designed to aid Microsoft partners in developing an awareness of Responsible AI as they engage in AI projects for their customers.  By the end of the workshop partners will be able to:

* Conduct similar workshops with your employees to ensure their specific AI principles are proliferated throughout the organization

* Conduct similar workshops with your customers to ensure your joint AI principles are adhered to throughout shared projects

* Create a process/committee for governance and to resolve internal escalations of possible Responsible AI conflicts

* Establish a 1-hour quarterly rhythm with Microsoft for bi-directional communications regarding Responsible AI

  
## Direct Engagment vs. Indirect Engagement
* **Direct Engagement** is where you are planning to build a service practice that helps customers directly with RAI. Possibly a service offering in RAI? But direct, attributable revenue will be the outcome of this path.

* **Indirect Engagement** (probably 80% of Partners attending this workshop) is where you will absorb the message/principles taught and proliferate them through your offerings and employee/customer conversations. It has been shown by some partners to get them into deals they may not have been in before but largely it is part of HOW you do business and your own “SDLC” (Software Development Life Cycle).



## Prerequisites
